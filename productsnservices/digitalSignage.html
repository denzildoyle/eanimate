		       	<h4>Micros Property Management Solutions</h4><br>
		       	<p>Your front desk often makes the difference between 'never agains' and 'long-term relationships.' The OPERA Property Management System (PMS) is designed to meet the varied requirements of any size hotel or hotel chain. OPERA PMS provides all the tools your hotel staff needs for doing their day-to-day jobs; handling reservations, checking guests in and out, assigning rooms and managing room inventory, accommodating the needs of in-house guests, and handling accounting and billing.<br><br></p>

		       	<h6>Reservations</h6> 
		       	<p>Features are integrated with other functionality such as profiles, cashiering and deposits. This property management software module provides a complete set of features for creating and updating individual, group and business block reservations, including deposit handling, cancellations, confirmations, wait listing, room blocking and sharing.<br><br></p>

				<h6>Rate Management</h6>		
				<p>an extensive set of features for setting and automatically controlling rates, for rate quotation, and for revenue forecasting and analysis to create the most comprehensive rate management system in the industry. OPERA's Property Management Systems interface with OPERA Revenue Management Systems and other major yield management applications.<br><br></p>

				<h6>Profiles</h6>
				<p>complete demographic records for guests, business accounts, contacts, groups, agents and sources.

				<h6>Rooms Management</h6>
				<p>handles all facets of room supervision including availability, housekeeping, maintenance and facility management. The Queue Rooms feature of the property management software coordinates Front Office and Housekeeping efforts when guests are waiting for rooms which are not immediately available for assignment.<br><br></p>

				<h6>Cashiering</h6>
				<p>posting guest and passer-by charges (including taxes and other generates), making posting adjustments, managing advance deposits, settlements, checkout and folio printing are a few of the many activities handled by OPERA Cashiering.

				<h6>Fully Configurable</h6>
				<p>choice of OPERA features, system behaviours and priorities, and system-wide defaults are controlled by the property. User permissions determine which property management software features may be accessed by each user and user group. Many OPERA screens may be customized by the property.<br><br></p>

				<h6>Global Perspective</h6>
				<p>supports multi-currency and multi-language features to meet the requirements of global operations. Rates and revenues can be dynamically converted from the local currency to any other currency.

		       	<h4>Digital Signage</h4><br>
		       	<p>Digital Signage is a name given to any number of methods used to electronically display multimedia content. These systems, alternatively known as dynamic or electronic signage have been rapidly expanding on a global scale. These networks of signs can be deployed across hotels, retail chains, travel hubs and offices to deliver informative advertising and entertaining content to capture specific audiences and passers by.<br><br>

				The benefits of digital signage over static signs are clear. Content can be easily modified, animations or videos can be shown and advertisements can be adapted to a specific audience; all of which would enable you to build brand awareness, enhance your environment and influence customer behaviour.<br><br></p>

						These systems can also be interfaced with your Point-of-Sale so that menu and price changes on the back-end POS will also be reflected on the menu boards.<br><br>
